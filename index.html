    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Chrome Tools!</h1>

    <h2 class="text-center">How do I access it?</h2>
    <p>
      You may already be familiar with Chrome Dev Tools.
      In case you aren't, you can access those tools several ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Through the Chrome menu. More Tools --> Developer Tools</li>
      <li>Right-click and select inspect (Elements tab)</li>
      <li>Keyboard shortcut Alt-Cmd-I (Elements tab)</li>
      <li>Keyboard shortcut Alt-Cmd-J (Console tab)</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="text-center">Tabs? Huh?</h2>
    <p>
      Now that you have the Chrome tools open, notice the tabs listed along the top.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elements: Shows you the HTML. Hovering on a tag shows you it's box model properties.</li>
      <li>Console: Anything JavaScript outputs (including errors) goes here</li>
      <li>Sources: This shows you all the files that went into this webpage. Debugging happens here.</li>
      <li>Network: This tab shows you stuff about how the files on the page loaded including status codes, request and response headers, etc.</li>
      <li>The rest we won't be using much, but you can learn about them on your own!</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="text-center">What's that phone icon thingy?</h2>
    <p>
      To the left of your tabs you will see a little icon that looks like a
      cell phone next to a tablet. Click on it and see what it does!
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Why do you think it's useful to see what your site looks like on a phone?</li>
      <li>What is "responsive design"?</li>
      <li>What percentage of website traffic do you think comes from phones?</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>

    <h2 class="text-center">How about this debugging business?</h2>
    <p>
      I've attached a JavaScript file with a bunch of code I wrote. However I've made a
      few errors so you'll need to correct them for me! You'll want to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the console tab find out the line that the error happens on.</li>
      <li>Errors will show up in the console and source tabs in red</li>
      <li>You can also look in your IDEâ€”most IDEs have some way of showing when there are typos, you can look at this for some of your errors.</li>
      <li>Some of these errors will be easily identified by javascript's built in error handler, but others might not be so obvious. Use the console logs to help you find out where things are failing.</li>
      <li>Change your code, refresh the page, and try again</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-center">What's my assignment?</h2>
    <p>Find and fix the errors in debug.js. You may need to google the error message to find out what it's really saying.</p>
    <h2 id="finish" style="color:#ff66cc;"></h2>
    <br><br><br>
    <em>Hint: You will see a message pop up above if you've finished the assignment.</em>
    <em style="display: block">2nd Hint: go to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/">The Google Developer Site</a> for more in depth instruction on how to use the debugger if you get stuck.</em>
